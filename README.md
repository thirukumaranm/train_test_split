# Train_Test_Split


# Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques to a real-world dataset. The goal is to prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling.



## Instructions

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Data Cleaning:**
    - Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Explain your approach and techniques used for dealing with missing data.

2. **Feature Scaling:**
    - Apply appropriate feature scaling techniques (e.g., Standardization or Min-Max scaling) to normalize the numerical features in the dataset.

3. **Handling Categorical Data:**
    - Encode categorical variables using suitable techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding. Explain the rationale behind your choice.

### Feature Engineering

- Apply at least two feature engineering techniques to create new meaningful features from the existing ones. Explain why you selected these techniques and how they enhance the dataset's representational power.

### Handling Imbalanced Data

- If your dataset has imbalanced classes, address this issue using a technique of your choice (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, SMOTE, or any other method). Provide details on how you handled class imbalance.

### Data Transformation

- After completing data preprocessing and feature engineering, save the preprocessed dataset as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Analysis

- Provide visualizations and summary statistics to illustrate the impact of data preprocessing and feature engineering on the dataset. Discuss how these techniques improved the dataset's stability for machine learning tasks.

## Conclusion

- Summarize the key takeaways from this assignment, including the importance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in preparing data for machine learning models.

## Submission

- Ensure your assignment is well-organized, clear, and easy to follow.
- Include the file or attachment link to the preprocessed CSV dataset in your submission.
